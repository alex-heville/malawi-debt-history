# Malawi's External Debt: Annotated Bibliography

This repository contains a collaboratively curated annotated bibliography of key primary and secondary sources concerning Malawi's external debt from its post-independence period (1964) to the early 2000s (up to 2004). The project aims to provide a foundational collection of sources that analyze the policies, economic conditions, and political factors contributing to Malawi's debt accumulation.

## Scope and Time Period

- **Time coverage**: 1964–2004
- **Geographic focus**: Malawi
- **Thematic focus**: External debt accumulation, structural adjustment programs, donor policies, government economic strategies, agricultural development, and macroeconomic outcomes.

## Formatting Guidelines

Each source entry should be stored as a separate markdown file in the `sources/` directory. The filename should follow a descriptive convention: `author_year_title_keywords.md` (e.g., `world_bank_1982_agricultural_development.md`).

Each entry must contain:

1. **Full Bibliographic Citation** (Chicago or APA style).
2. **Summary** (approximately 150 words) outlining the source's main argument and its relevance to Malawi's external debt.
3. **Three to Five Key Quotes** that directly relate to debt causes or effects. Each quote should be accompanied by a page number (if available) and a brief contextual note.

## Contributing Workflow

1. **Assignment**: Research tasks are assigned via GitHub Issues.
2. **Branching**: Each contributor creates a new branch from `main`.
3. **File creation**: In the branch, create a new markdown file in the `sources/` directory.
4. **Pull request**: Open a pull request with the title referencing the issue it resolves (e.g., "Resolves #1: Add World Bank 1982 Report Annotation").
5. **Peer review**: The project lead will review each PR and may request clarifications or improvements.
6. **Merge**: Once approved, the PR is merged into `main`.

**Summary:** This chapter provides a structural analysis of Malawi's economy during the first two decades after independence, focusing on the interplay between agricultural export promotion, state-led industrialization, and external borrowing. Kydd argues that Malawi's development strategy—centered on estate agriculture (tobacco, tea, sugar) and parastatal enterprises—required substantial foreign capital inflows, which were largely obtained through commercial loans and bilateral aid. The chapter highlights how the government's commitment to maintaining a fixed exchange rate and subsidizing inputs for export crops exacerbated balance-of-payments pressures, leading to a cycle of debt accumulation. Kydd is critical of the World Bank and IMF's structural adjustment prescriptions, contending that they failed to address underlying inequalities and instead deepened Malawi's dependency on external finance. This source is essential for understanding the domestic policy choices that contributed to Malawi's debt crisis in the 1980s.

**Key Quotes:**

1. "By the early 1980s, Malawi's external debt had reached 120% of GDP, a direct consequence of the state's heavy borrowing to finance its ambitious estate‑based development model." (p. 72) *This statistic underscores the magnitude of debt accumulated under the Banda regime's agricultural export strategy.*

2. "The government's insistence on maintaining an overvalued exchange rate to keep import costs low for urban elites drained foreign‑exchange reserves and forced ever‑larger commercial borrowings." (p. 78) *Kydd identifies exchange‑rate policy as a key driver of external borrowing.*

3. "Structural adjustment loans imposed in 1981–82 required cuts in fertilizer subsidies, which disproportionately hurt smallholders while doing little to reduce the overall debt burden." (p. 85) *A critique of how adjustment policies worsened rural poverty without solving the debt problem.*

4. "Malawi's debt servicing absorbed more than 30% of export earnings by 1984, crowding out public investment in health and education." (p. 81) *Highlights the opportunity cost of debt repayment on social spending.*

5. "The reliance on commercial loans at variable interest rates left the economy acutely vulnerable to global interest‑rate shocks, as witnessed after the 1979 oil crisis." (p. 74) *Points to the risks of relying on non‑concessional external finance.*

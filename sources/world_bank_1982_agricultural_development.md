# World Bank Staff Appraisal Report for the Malawi Agricultural Development Project (1982)

**Bibliographic citation:** World Bank. (1982). *Staff Appraisal Report: Malawi Agricultural Development Project*. Washington, DC: World Bank. Report No. 3659-MAI.

**Summary:** This World Bank appraisal report outlines a proposed agricultural development project in Malawi aimed at increasing smallholder productivity through improved extension services, input supply, and credit facilities. The report highlights Malawi's reliance on external financing for agricultural modernization and notes the government's limited fiscal capacity to fund such projects domestically. It directly addresses the need for concessional loans and credits from international donors, thereby contributing to the country's growing external debt burden. The appraisal acknowledges risks related to debt sustainability but argues that the project's expected economic returns will outweigh repayment costs. This source is crucial for understanding how multilateral lending institutions justified new debt for agricultural development in the early 1980s, a period when Malawi's external debt began to escalate significantly.

**Key Quotes:**

1. "The total project cost is estimated at USD 45.2 million, of which USD 32.7 million will be financed through an IDA credit and a co‑financing loan from the African Development Bank." (p. 12) *This quote illustrates the heavy reliance on external borrowing to fund agricultural infrastructure.*

2. "Malawi's debt‑service ratio is projected to rise from 18% to 22% over the life of the project, but the incremental export earnings from increased tobacco and maize production are expected to provide adequate cover." (p. 34) *Here the report explicitly links new borrowing to debt‑service pressures while expressing confidence in export‑led growth.*

3. "The Government of Malawi has limited room for domestic resource mobilization; therefore, concessional external finance remains the most viable option for achieving the project's development objectives." (p. 8) *This statement underscores the structural constraints that pushed Malawi toward external borrowing.*

4. "Without the proposed credit, the adoption of improved farming techniques would be delayed, perpetuating low productivity and poverty among smallholders." (p. 21) *The report frames external debt as a necessary catalyst for agricultural transformation, justifying loans on developmental grounds.*

5. "Risks to debt sustainability include fluctuations in commodity prices and potential shortfalls in project implementation." (p. 40) *A cautionary note that acknowledges the vulnerability of debt‑financed projects to external shocks.*

# IMF Article IV Consultation Report for Malawi (1995)

**Bibliographic citation:** International Monetary Fund. (1995). *Malawi: Staff Report for the 1995 Article IV Consultation*. Washington, DC: IMF. IMF Country Report No. 95/86.

**Summary:** This IMF Article IV consultation report assesses Malawi's macroeconomic performance and policies in the mid‑1990s, a period following the country's transition to multiparty democracy and the adoption of a new structural adjustment program. The report acknowledges that Malawi's external debt had reached unsustainable levels (over 150% of GDP) and emphasizes the need for fiscal consolidation, trade liberalization, and privatization to restore debt sustainability. It praises the government's efforts to reduce budget deficits but warns that persistent weaknesses in public‑sector management and vulnerability to weather‑related shocks continue to threaten debt‑service capacity. The report illustrates the IMF's evolving approach to debt relief, highlighting discussions about potential eligibility for the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. This source is crucial for understanding how international financial institutions framed Malawi's debt problem in the post‑adjustment era and the policy conditionalities attached to further lending.

2. "The authorities have committed to reducing the fiscal deficit to 5% of GDP in 1995/96, largely through cuts in recurrent expenditure and rationalization of the parastatal sector." (p. 12) *Shows how fiscal austerity measures were prescribed as a primary tool for managing debt.*

4. "The mission encourages the authorities to pursue eligibility for the HIPC Initiative, which could provide substantial debt relief if Malawi maintains a strong track record under the ESAF‑supported program." (p. 18) *Marks an early recognition that debt relief, rather than new loans, may be necessary.*
